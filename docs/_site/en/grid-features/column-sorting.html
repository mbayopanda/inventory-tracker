      <h1 id="column-sorting"><strong>Column Sorting</strong></h1>

<p>Most columns in a grid are sortable by clicking on the column headers.  For numeric data, the grid will order values by size, while text is sorted alphabetically.  A small triangle will appear in the grid header to indicate the sort direction - ascending or descending.  One click sort ascending, the second sorts descending, and the final click removes the sort.</p>

<h2 id="column-reordering">Column Reordering</h2>

<p>Some grids support column reordering by clicking down and holding the column header, then dragging left of right.  If the grid has column reordering enabled, you will see a faded image of the column appear to be dragged across the underlying grid.  Releasing the mouse will put the column in the new location.</p>

<p>This feature is particularly useful for customizing your views.  If you wish to see debits next to transaction ids, you can simply drag the columns to be side by side for a quick comparison.</p>

<h2 id="column-resizing">Column Resizing</h2>

<p>Most grids allow you to resize their columns by clicking on the right side of the grid column and expanding or contracting the space.</p>

<h2 id="column-visibility">Column Visibility</h2>

<p>Some grids allow a user to show or hide columns.  This is particularly useful when you wish to reduce the clutter on a particular view of the data by hiding unnecessary columns.</p>

<p>To toggle the visibility of the columns in the grid, go to <strong>Menu **(&lt;i class=”fa fa-hamburger”&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) &gt; **Columns</strong>.  A modal of column names will appear with checkboxes to toggle their visibility.  Once the changes have been made, submit the modal and the grid will show only the selected columns.</p>
