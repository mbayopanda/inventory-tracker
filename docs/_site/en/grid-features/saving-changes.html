<p>Some grids support saving the view a user customized by saving the grid configuration. Once a user has customized the grid in the fashion they desire by manipulating column sizes, visibility and ordering, they can persist the view across session by saving the configuration.</p>

<p>To save the grid configuration, go to <strong>Menu</strong>(&lt;i class=”fa fa-hamburger”&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) &gt;<strong>Save Grid Configuration</strong>. A success message should appear to notify the user that the configuration was saved.</p>

<p>To return to the default configuration, go to <strong>Menu</strong>(&lt;i class=”fa fa-hamburger”&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) &gt;<strong>Clear Grid Configuration</strong>. This will removed the saved grid configuration and restore the default grid configuration.</p>
