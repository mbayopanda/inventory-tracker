      <h1 id="patient-invoicing">Patient Invoicing</h1>

<p>BHIMA packages a powerful, flexible, and simple patient invoicing module.  Patients are invoiced for goods and services in the <a href="#">inventory</a>.  At the time of invoicing, the price of individual items are calculated from the base price of the inventory and any price lists that may apply to the patient.  Furthermore, an additional charge, known as an <a href="#">Invoice Fee</a>, or an additional reduction, known as a <a href="#">Subsidy</a>, can be applied at the time of invoice based on the patientâ€™s debtor or patient groups.  Taken together, these allow an institution to model a series of complex invoicing scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="invoice-item-prices">Invoice Item Prices</h2>

<p>If a price list exists, the prices on that list will always override the inventory price. However, the system seeks to apply the lowest price possible for any particular item - if multiple price lists apply to the patient, the items will assume their lowest possible price across all price lists (need to check that this is the case).</p>
