      <h1 id="account-statement-module">Account Statement Module</h1>

<p>The Account Statement module provides a detailed view of transactions in the <a href="/en/finance/ledgers/general-ledger.html">General Ledger</a> for a particular account.  It is identical to the Account Statement Report (found under Reports &gt; Account Statement Report).  Since the information comes for the General Ledger, it must be have already been posted from the Journal.</p>

<p>The module is divided into sections: the filter bar, the grid, and the footer.</p>

<h4 id="filter-bar">Filter Bar</h4>

<p>The module requires the standard<a href="/grid-features.md"> default filters </a>of limit and period.  Additionally, you must provide a default account.  This allows the module to assume an account is always set and display opening balances and movements throughout the period in a meaningful way.</p>

<h4 id="grid">Grid</h4>

<p>The heart of the module is a grid supporting many of the <a href="/grid-features.md">grid features</a> found in BHIMA.  This view differs from the Journal by limiting the records to only a single account.  Typically, the view will show a single side of a transaction.  To show the other side of the transaction, you can follow the links in the <strong>Transaction ID</strong> column to view the transaction in the <a href="/journal-module.md">Journal</a>.</p>
